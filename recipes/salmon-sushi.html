    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori and smoked salmon. This is
      a <br />
      very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to
      learn how to<br />
      make a prefect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese<br />
      horseradish) for a good kick!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
      <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
      <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 avocado-peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook rice in a rice cooker with
          2 cups of water.<br />
          Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread
          rice on plate<br />
          until completely cool.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool
          rice on<br />
          seaweed, leaving at least 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the
          seaweed<br />
          uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice;
          arrange<br />
          smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from
          the<br />
          bottom edge of seaweed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom
          to the top<br />
          edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 pieces
          and<br />
          serve. Repeat for other rolls.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
